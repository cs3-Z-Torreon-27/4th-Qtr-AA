            <div class="title"> Io (Moon of Jupiter) </div>
                <div class = "content2">
                    <p>
                        Composition: Io's surface is primarily composed of sulfur and silicate rock, with active volcanoes erupting sulfur compounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Location: Io is the innermost of Jupiter's Galilean moons, orbiting at a distance of about 421,700 kilometers from Jupiter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surface: Io's surface is dominated by colorful volcanic plains, lava flows, and calderas, with few impact craters due to ongoing volcanic activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Geology: Io's geology is characterized by extensive volcanic activity driven by tidal heating from Jupiter's gravity, resulting in a constantly changing surface landscape.
                    </p>

            <div class="title"> Titan (Moon of Saturn) </div>
                <div class = "content2">
                    <p>
                        Composition: Titan's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with methane and ethane clouds, while its surface features lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Location: Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, orbiting at an average distance of about 1,221,870 kilometers from Saturn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surface: Titan's surface is obscured by a thick haze, but radar mapping has revealed a diverse landscape including hydrocarbon lakes, dunes, and cryovolcanic features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Geology: Titan's geology is shaped by a combination of surface processes including erosion by liquid methane and ethane, cryovolcanism, and tectonic activity.
                    </p>

            <div class="title"> Titania (Moon of Uranus) </div>
                <div class = "content2">
                    <p>
                        Composition: Titania's surface is composed of water ice and rocky material, with some regions showing signs of tectonic activity.
                    </p>
                        Location: Titania is the largest moon of Uranus, orbiting at an average distance of about 436,300 kilometers from Uranus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surface: Titania's surface is heavily cratered, with impact basins and dark patches thought to be regions of relatively fresh ice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Geology: Titania's geology includes fault scarps, valleys, and ridges, suggesting past tectonic activity that has modified its surface.

            <div class="title"> Triton (Moon of Neptune) </div>
                <div class = "content2">
                    <p>
                        Composition: Triton's surface is a mix of geologically young icy plains, ridges, and impact craters, with evidence of cryovolcanism. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Location: Triton is the largest moon of Neptune and is believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object, orbiting at an average distance of about 354,800 kilometers from Neptune.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surface: Triton's surface features icy plains, cryovolcanic terrains, and dark streaks formed by geysers erupting nitrogen gas and dark particles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Geology: Triton's geology includes evidence of recent geological activity such as cryovolcanism and resurfacing processes that have erased older impact craters.
